# Hi!

## Purpose
This repo is just to play around with modding and learn C#.

## Why use the example mod?
Easier to learn how to mod with examples, and can take other peoples code and implement it in my own ways.

## What if I make something worth sharing?
I'll seperate it into a seperate repo and will share it on the workshop. I haven't ever tried doing pixel art though so I would need to spend time learning or get someone else to do that.

## Why am I writing this when no one will read it?
Someone might read it, but also good to introspect, otherwise life becomes too autopilot :).
